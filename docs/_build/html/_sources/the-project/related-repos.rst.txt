STIG Manager Accessories
#############################################################

The STIG Manager API is designed and documented such that additional clients can be developed to enhance its utility for users. 

The STIG Manager OSS project provides the main reference UI Client, described in this documentation, as part of its main repository on GitHub.

If other projects want to contribute a client or other stand-alone enhancements to the tool, create a Pull Request and we will link to them here.



STIGMan Watcher
===========================

The STIG Manager Watcher utility is also maintained by same STIG Manager OSS group as the main project, and serves as the reference Command Line Utility. It is a Node.js app that will monitor a specific folder for .ckl or XCCDF .xml files and automatically import them into a designated Collection. 

See the ref::`STIGMan Watcher Repo` for more details.
