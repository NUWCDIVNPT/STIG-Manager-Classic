STIG Manager Logging 
########################################


STIG Manager writes all log entries to STDOUT and STDERR. Use the ``docker logs`` or equivalent container engine command to view them.


How you capture and persist these log entries will depend on your Organizational requirements. 



.. rubric:: Log format

With few exceptions, the logs follow the Apache Common Log Format. Fields are in this order:

``ip - user - timestamp - verb - request - response code``


At startup log entries may be preceded by labels such ``[AUTH]`` or ``[DB]`` indicating the portion of the API that is attempting to establish itself.
