STIG Review Handling
########################################


STIG Manager and many other STIG tools, such as STIG Viewer, treat STIGs as checklists composed of re-usable Rules. These Rules are often re-used for each Revision of a STIG exactly as they are. However, Rules can also be changed with each STIG Revision. These changes can be significant, or quite trivial. Whenever DISA makes a change to a STIG Rule, often only the Rule ID will change to identify the new version of the Rule, but the Group Number will stay the same. 

This is because DISA does not want to change the Group Number, as that would require the Rule to be re-authorized by the STIG Working Group.


STIG Manager attempts to present as many Reviews as possible when viewing a given Revision of a STIG. 

STIG Checklists contain many Rule identifiers and data that could be used to track the Review that evaluates each Rule. STIG Manager uses the following identifiers to track Reviews:
  - Rule "Version" (often called "STIG Id")
  - The Rule's check content, in the form of a unique SHA-256 digest of that check content.

When DISA Reference STIG releases are imported into STIG Manager, the unique STIG Id and check content digests are recorded for each Rule in that revision.  When viewing Review workspaces, STIG Manager will present the Rules contained in the selected STIG Revision, and all the Reviews that are attached to those Rule's unique keys, the STIG ID and Check Content Digest.

This behavior lets a large proportion of Reviews that were performed with the previous STIG Revision to be presented when viewing the new STIG Revision. This is a great time saver for Reviewers, as they will only need to perform Reviews on the Rules that have been added or where the actual Check they are performing has changed.



A Reviewer may perform a Review on a Rule in a previous STIG Revision, and then later view a new STIG Revision and see that the Review they just performed is not present. This is because the Review was performed

Review Handling Comparison with STIG Viewer
=======================================================


STIG Viewer performs carry forward by matching the left-hand component of the ruleIds in your SCAP results to whatever Manual STIG you used to create the STIG Viewer checklist. My customer has rejected that approach because it imports results for ruleIds for which the check content was changed. So the previous assessment should NOT be used. They funded the more sophisticated approach taken by STIG Manager, where we look at whether the check content changed between ruleIds.













































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Users have asked the question, Mr. STIG Man, why does the STIG Viewer show a different Review than the STIG Manager? The answer is that the STIG Viewer does not treat Reviews
